Archeology website containing 2 parts
first part - Save The Past:

The web application enables archaeologists, students, or volunteers to photograph an archaeological find 
from all angles using a phone or tablet camera. The app uses image recognition and 3D reconstruction
 technology to create an accurate three-dimensional model of the artifact, even when it is fragile or
 at risk of deterioration. This allows the find to be fully documented on site, immediately upon its discovery.

After the model is created, the system generates a digital information card for each artifact, 
including essential details such as the discovery location, excavation layer, raw materials, 
estimated age, possible use, and historical significance.
All data is stored in the cloud (local storage for begining),
ensuring that the information is preserved even if the physical artifact is damaged or destroyed.


second part - PastPalette:
The web application enables archaeologists, students, or volunteers to photograph an archaeological find.
it then does multiple reconstructions of that artifect.
the technological system makes it possible to view multiple possible color reconstructions of the same artifact,
 rather than a single version. Through an application or an interactive display, 
 the visitor can choose between different reconstructions: based on pigments that were found,
 based on the historical period and culture, or based on similar artifacts from other regions.
